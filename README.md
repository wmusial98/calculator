basic in-browser calculator made alongside TOP

## Preview
I will be approaching this project from a different angle than usual, using an iterative process of writing tests and testing functions to get the basic functionality of the calculator working rather than suggested browser console testing. This should help me figure out how to write test files as well as writing good tests. From there, I will be following The Odin Project guidelines for the calculator project at the end of the Foundations course, found here: https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-calculator
